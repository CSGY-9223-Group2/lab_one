# This script includes the following vulnerabilities for educational purposes only:

# SQL Injection: The vulnerable_function takes user input and directly constructs a SQL query, making it susceptible to SQL injection attacks.
# Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The vulnerable_function returns HTML content that contains user input, which can be exploited for XSS attacks if not properly sanitized.
# Command Injection: The main function allows users to enter a command that is executed using subprocess.run, making it vulnerable to command injection attacks.
# File Path Traversal: The main function allows users to enter a file path, which could potentially lead to file path traversal attacks if not properly validated.
# Remote Code Execution (RCE): The main function allows users to enter a URL, which is then fetched using urllib.request.urlopen. If the URL contains malicious code, it could be executed on the server.
# Sensitive Data Exposure: The main function directly prints a hardcoded password, which should be securely stored and handled to avoid exposure.

# Important Considerations:

# Controlled Environment: Run this script in a controlled environment where you can safely test and analyze the vulnerabilities without affecting production systems.
# False Positives: CodeQL might occasionally generate false positives, so it's important to review and understand the reported vulnerabilities to determine their validity.
# Mitigation: Once you've identified vulnerabilities using CodeQL, implement appropriate mitigation techniques to address them and prevent real-world exploitation.

# By running this script through CodeQL, you should be able to see it detect and report the various security vulnerabilities present in the code. This can help you practice identifying and addressing security issues in your own Python projects.

# v 2024_10_17 16-53-20 update test for CodeQL
